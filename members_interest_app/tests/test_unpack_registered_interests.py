# I am not going to write a test for the functions that unpack registered interest data/
# Having looked at a csv output, the data looks fairly useable. There are lots of quality issues
# which need addressing e.g. regex patterns overmatching etc.
# But I want to get some rough data quickly, and while I aim to produce code that is fairly production ready,
# This is not a commercial production environment; it is a learning project.
